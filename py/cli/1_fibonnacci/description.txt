The first challenge in the Python CLI competition is the Fibonnacci Series challenge.

What is the Fibonnacci Series? Fi·bo·nac·ci se·ries
		noun: Fibonacci sequence
		a series of numbers in which each number ( Fibonacci number ) is the sum of the two preceding numbers.
		The simplest is the series 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc.

Teams will be required to write a program that can provide the Fibonnacci Series to the nth integer.
by calculation, not memorization. This means that the program must calculate each integer up to the 
specified place. The program should take user input for the number of items, calculate the series, and
display the series in a neatly formatted layout.

Bonus: 
	Include a generator for a Look & Say sequence to the nth integer.
	
	What is the Look & Say Sequence?
	
		 Look and say sequence: In mathematics, the look-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers as below:

         1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, 312211, 13112221, 1113213211, …

         To generate a term of the sequence from the previous term, just ‘look and say or read’
         the digits of the previous member. For example:1 is read off as “one 1″ or 11. 11 is read
         off as “two 1s” or 21. 21 is read off as “one 2, then one 1″ or 1211. 1211 is read off as 
         “one 1, then one 2, then two 1s” or 111221. And so forth.

You will be judged on:

		- Function (out of 20)
				- Does your program complete the requisites using calculation?
		- Format (out of 10)
				- Does your program take user input efficiently?
				- Does your program format the output in an easily readable manner?
		- Code (out of 10)
				- Is your code formatted correctly making use of comments, variables, and indentation?
		- Bonus (up to 10)
				- Does your program include the features in the bonus category?
				- How well are these features implemented?
